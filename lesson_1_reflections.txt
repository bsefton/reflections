 dont have any questions

 How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

 Blah blah blah


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?


Having old version will allow faster debugging, reversion to earlier versions and build a source code repository for future us.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?


It is possible to forget to make a committ and then lose work or make comitts which are too large.
